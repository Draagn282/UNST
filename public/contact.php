        <p>
          We were founded the moment that space travel became possible. Suddenly
          The earth was not a boundary anymore. Planets were the new
          destinations. Our founder, Doris van Parken wanted to give the human
          race an easy way to safety, fast, cheap and secure way to travel in
          space. He started to first build his own first spaceship. It blew up
          and he died but his blueprints were found and used by the current head
          of our company, Danish Harker. With those blueprints he started to
          build more and more ships, With his gain he started a company. This
          company. It was super successful. With more and more ships, journeys,
          planets and new technologies. We still thrive today. All thanks to
          you!

        <p>
          Right now we have many planets, ships, journeys and staff. We keep
          growing in scale and not slowing down. With our new partner, the title
          wave we have found new opportunities to grow and thrive. New staff,
          management and ships will be available to the public in a few months.
          But that's not all we have great new things planned. We don't want to
          ruin the surprise but we can say that the reformation has begun. As
          you just read we have many things planned and in the works. We want to
          make sure that anyone can enjoy a pleasant flight with no hiccups,
          mishaps, problems or negative emotions. We don't strive for
          perfection, we strive beyond that. So we continue for performance,
          perfection and your wallet.
